8. **Deploy smart contracts (optional for local development)**

```bash
cd ../contracts
touch .env
```
Add the following variables to the file:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.base.org
BASE_MAINNET_RPC_URL=your_mainnet_rpc_provider_url_for_base
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
```

6. **Install contracts dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

Edit the `.env` file with your private key and RPC URLs, then:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
```



## 🧪 Development Workflow

1. **Branch Naming Convention**
   - Features: `feature/feature-name`
   - Bugfixes: `fix/bug-description`
   - Improvements: `improve/improvement-description`

2. **Commit Message Format**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Begin with a verb in imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")

3. **Pull Request Process**
   - Create a PR against the `main` branch
   - Add relevant reviewers
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed
